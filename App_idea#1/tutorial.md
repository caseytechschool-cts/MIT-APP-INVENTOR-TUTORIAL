# App tutorial

Welcome to the app development tutorial. This tutorial is intented for begineers who just started exploring app development world with low and no-coding approach. Throughout this tutorial, I will use **MIT App Inventor** website to design and develop an app.

### **Things you need**
1. Computer (laptop or desktop) with internet connection
2. A Gmail address to login into the MIT App Inventor website
3. Android phone or tablet for testing the app
4. [MIT AI2 Companion app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.mit.appinventor.aicompanion3) 
5. Optional: USB cable and [aiStarter](https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-emulator.html)

### **Outcome**
If you follow this tutorial, you will be able to:
1. use MIT App Inventor platform
2. design the user interface
3. build the logic
4. test and share the app at least two ways

## Setup
You need to setup once only. Depending on availablity of hardware and Internet connectivity, the setup process might differs a bit. However, here are the common steps you need to take to setup your environment.

> You need a Gmail address to login into your account. You can share the same Gmail address with multiple participants. However, **make sure that all sessions are alive.**

> Install [MIT AI2 Companion app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.mit.appinventor.aicompanion3) from the play store. This app allows you to test your app in an actual Android device.

> Install [aiStarter](https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-emulator.html) in your computer should you use a USB cable to connect a tablet with the computer.

## Building an app
You need to follow a two-stages principle to build an app. First, you need to design the layout of the app. How it looks like and what user interfaces you need to build it. Second, you need to think about how to make it working, so writing down all logic statements.

The first stage is known as **User Interface (UI) design**. In this stage, you not only design the interface but also consider the **User Experience (UX)**. Your design should balance on user experience. Indeed, you are making it for others to use.

To understand the difference between **UI** and **UX** checkout the follow image.

The top image shows a cute mug, which looks nice and creative. However, the user experience is really bad. While designing the user interface, make a smooth experience for your user, not yourself.
