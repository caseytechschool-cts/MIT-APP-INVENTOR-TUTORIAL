# User Interface and User Experience
When designing an app's user interface (UI), it is important to consider both aesthetics and usability to create a great user experience (UX).

## What is the Difference?
UI focuses on the visual design and layout of the app screen. This includes:
- Where menus, buttons, images, and text fields are located
- Visual hierarchy - what stands out first/most
- Colour schemes and typography

UX focuses on the full end-user interaction, including:
- How intuitive and easy is it to accomplish tasks?
- Does the layout match user expectations and mental models?
- How smooth and enjoyable is the overall process?

## Tips for Good UI/UX
When designing your app's interface, keep these tips in mind:
- **Consistency** - Use uniform elements and interaction patterns
- **Intuitiveness** - Design an obvious visual hierarchy and predictable interactions
- **Efficiency** - Minimise steps users need to take to achieve goals
- **Accessibility** - Accommodate users with disabilities
- **Feedback** - Provide indicators when actions are taking place
